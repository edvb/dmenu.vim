# dmenu.vim

A small vim plugin which provides a few commands for dmenu use in vim.

To open a file in vim with dmenu use the following, where the argument can be
any vim command, such as e, sp, vsp, etc.

	:DmenuFile "e"

To switch to a currently open buffer use the following, with again any vim
command.

	:DmenuBuf "e"

Run the following command to jump to a function or variable using ctags.
Currently it creates a tags file every time you run it, but hopefully this is
only temporary and it will simply create tags when needed in memory.

	:DmenuTag

## Configuration

To change the default dmenu command put the following in your `.vimrc`

	let g:dmenu_cmd = 'dmenu -i -l 20'

To change the default file list command put the following in your `.vimrc`

	let g:dmenu_ls = 'find -type f -printf "%P\n" | tail -n +2'

To change the default git file list command put the following in your `.vimrc`

	let g:dmenu_git_ls = 'git ls-files'

To change the default ctags command put the following in your `.vimrc`

	let g:dmenu_ctags = 'ctags -f - --sort=no -R . | cut -f 1'

## Installation

### 1. Put Files Into Root of the `.vim` Directory (Not Recommended)

Without a plug-in manger (like the ones below) you have to manually put each
file/folder (plugin/, doc/, autoload/, etc.) into the root of your .vim folder.
I highly recommend that you use one of the plug-in mangers below for less
manual work and easier organization.
